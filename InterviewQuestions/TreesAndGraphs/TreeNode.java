    /* Minimal Tree: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algoÂ­rithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
     * 
     * Hints: 
     * -> A minimal binary tree has about the same number of nodes on the left of each node as on the right. Let's focus on just the root for now. How would you ensure that about the same number of nodes are on the left of the root as on the right?
      * -> You could implement this by finding the "ideal" next element to add and repeatedly calling insertValue. This will be a bit inefficient, as you would have to repeatedly traverse the tree. Try recursion instead. Can you divide this problem into subproblems?
     * -> Imagine we had a createMinimalTree method that returns a minimal tree for a given array (but for some strange reason doesn't operate on the root of the tree). Could you use this to operate on the root of the tree? Could you write the base case for the function? Great! Then that's basically the entire function.   
     * 
     * Solution #1: Implement simple root.insertNode(int v) method which inserts the value v through a recursive process that starts with the root node....requires traversing the tree for each insertion, giving a total cost of O(log N)
     * 
     * Solution #2: Cut out traversals with createMinimalBST method, which is passed a subsection of the array and returns the root of a minimal tree
     * -> Insert into the tree the middle element of the array
     * -> Insert (into the left subtree) the left subarray elements
     * -> Insert (into the right subtree) the right subarray elements

    /* 4.5 Validate BST: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
     * 
     * Hints: 
     * -> If you traversed the tree using an in-order traversal and the elements were truly in the right order, does this indicate that the tree is actually in order? What happens for duplicate elements? If duplicate elements are allowed, they must be on a specific side (usually the left).
     * -> To be a binary search tree, it's not sufficient that the left.value <= current.value < right.value for each node.Every node on the left must be less than the current node, which must be less than all the nodes on the right.
     * -> If every node on the left must be less than or equal to the current node, then this is really the same thing as saying that the biggest node on the left must be less than or equal to the current node.
     * -> Rather than validating the current node's value against leftTree.max and rightTree.min, can we flip around the logic? Validate the left tree's nodes to ensure that they are smaller than current.value.
     * -> Think about the checkBST function as a recursive function that ensures each node is within an allowable (min, max)range. At first,this range is infinite. When we traverse to the left, the min is negative infinity and the max is root. value. Can you implement this recursive function and properly adjust these ranges as you traverse the tree?
     * 
     * Check book for In-Order Traversal Solution (can't handle dups!)
     * 
     * Solution: The Min Max Implementation
     * -> We start with a range of(min = NULL, max = NULL), which the root obviously meets.(NULL indicates that there is no min or max.) We then branch left,checking that these nodes are within the range (min = NULL, max = 20). Then, we branch right, checking that the nodes are within the range (min = 20, max = NULL). We proceed through the tree with this approach. When we branch left, the max gets updated. When we branch right, the min gets updated. If anything fails these checks, we stop and return false.
