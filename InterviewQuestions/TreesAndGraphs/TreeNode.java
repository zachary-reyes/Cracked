     * -> If you traversed the tree using an in-order traversal and the elements were truly in the right order, does this indicate that the tree is actually in order? What happens for duplicate elements? If duplicate elements are allowed, they must be on a specific side (usually the left).
     * -> To be a binary search tree, it's not sufficient that the left.value <= current.value < right.value for each node.Every node on the left must be less than the current node, which must be less than all the nodes on the right.
     * -> If every node on the left must be less than or equal to the current node, then this is really the same thing as saying that the biggest node on the left must be less than or equal to the current node.
     * -> Rather than validating the current node's value against leftTree.max and rightTree.min, can we flip around the logic? Validate the left tree's nodes to ensure that they are smaller than current.value.
     * -> Think about the checkBST function as a recursive function that ensures each node is within an allowable (min, max)range. At first,this range is infinite. When we traverse to the left, the min is negative infinity and the max is root. value. Can you implement this recursive function and properly adjust these ranges as you traverse the tree?

A tree T2 is a subtree of Tl if there exists a node n in Tl such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical. 
     * 
     * Hints: 
     * -> If T2 is a subtree of Tl, how will its in-order traversal compare to Tl's? What about its pre-order and post-order traversal?
     * -> The in-order traversals won't tell us much. After all, every binary search tree with the same values (regardless of structure) will have the same in-order traversal. This is what in-order traversal means: contents are in-order. (And if it won't work in the specific case of a binary search tree, then it certainly won't work for a general binary tree.) The preÂ­ order traversal, however, is much more indicative.
     * -> You may have concluded that if T2.preorderTraversal() is a substring of Tl.preorderTraversal(), then T2 is a subtree of Tl. This is almost true, except that the trees could have duplicate values. Suppose Tl and T2 have all duplicate values but different structures. The pre-order traversals will look the same even though T2 is not a subtree of Tl. How can you handle situations like this?
     * -> Although the problem seems like it stems from duplicate values, it's really deeper than that. The issue is that the pre-order traversal is the same only because there are null nodes that we skipped over (because they're null). Consider inserting a placeholder value into the pre-order traversal string whenever you reach a null node. Register the null node as a "real" node so that you can distinguish between the different structures.
     * -> Alternatively, we can handle this problem recursively. Given a specific node within Tl, can we check to see if its subtree matches T2?
     *

All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
     * 
     * Hints:
     * -> Be very careful in this problem to ensure that each node is equally likely and that your solution doesn't slow down the speed of standard binary search tree algorithms (like insert, find, and delete). Also, remember that even if you assume that it's a balanced binary search tree, this doesn't mean that the tree is full/complete/perfect.
     * -> This is your own binary search tree class, so you can maintain any information about the tree structure or nodes that you'd like (provided it doesn't have other negative implicaÂ­ tions, like making insert much slower). In fact, there's probably a reason the interview question specified that it was your own class. You probably need to store some addiÂ­tional information in order to implement this efficiently.
     * -> As a naive "brute force" algorithm, can you use a tree traversal algorithm to implement this algorithm? What is the runtime of this?
     * -> Alternatively, you could pick a random depth to traverse to and then randomly traverse, stopping when you get to that depth. Think this through, though. Does this work?
     * -> Picking a random depth won't help us much. First, there's more nodes at lower depths than higher depths. Second, even if we re-balanced these probabilities, we could hit a "dead end" where we meant to pick a node at depth 5 but hit a leaf at depth 3. Re-balancing the probabilities is an interesting , though.
     * -> A naive approach that many people come up with is to pick a random number between 1 and 3. If it's 1, return the current node. If it's 2, branch left. If it's 3, branch right. This solution doesn't work. Why not? Is there a way you can adjust it to make it work?
     * -> The reason that the earlier solution (picking a random number between 1 and 3) doesn't work is that the probabilities for the nodes won't be equal. For example, the root will be returned with probability X, even if there are 50+ nodes in the tree. Clearly, not all the nodes have probability X, so these nodes won't have equal probability. We can resolve this one issue by picking a random number between 1 and siz e_of_tree instead. This only resolves the issue for the root, though. What about the rest of the nodes?
     * -> The issue with the earlier solution is that there could be more nodes on one side of a node than the other. So, we need to weight the probability of going left and right based on the number of nodes on each side. How does this work, exactly? How can we know the number of nodes?
     * 
     * Option #1: Slow and Working
     * -> Copy all the nodes to an array and return a random element in the array
     * -> O(N) Space and Time, where N is the number of nodes in the tree
     * 
     ** Option #2: Slow and Working
     * -> Maintain an array at all times that lists all the nodes in the tree...removing nodes til we get our node
     * -> O(N) Space and Time, where N is the number of nodes in the tree
     * 
     *** Option #3: Slow and Working
     * -> label all the nodes with an index from 1 to N and label them in binary search tree order and return random index...need to update indices upon insert/delete
     * -> O(N) Space and Time, where N is the number of nodes in the tree
     * 
     **** Option #4: Fast and Not Working
     * -> pick a random depth, and then traverse left/right randomly until we go to that depth. This wouldn' t actually ensure that all nodes are equally likely to be chosen though.
     * 
     ***** Option #5: Fast and Not Working
     * -> Traverse randomly down the tree, at each node: with 1/3 odds return current node, traverse left, or traverse right. Does not distribute the probabilities evenly across the nodes
     * 
     ****** Option #6: Fast and Working
     * -> Resolving the issue with the root: Since we have N nodes, we must return the root node with 1/N probability. (In fact, we must return each node with 1/N probability. After all, we have N nodes and each must have equal probability. The total must be 1 (100%), therefore each must have 1/N probability.)
     * -> the odds of going right should be RIGHT_SIZE * 1/N.
     * -> the odds of going left should be LEFT_SIZE * 1/N.
     * In a balanced tree, O(log N)
     * 
     ******* Option #7: Fast and Working
     -> Random number calls can be expensive. The initial random number call indicates which node (i) to return, and then we're locating the ith node in an in-order traversal. Subtracting LEFT_SIZE from i reflects that,when we go right,we skip over LEFT_SIZE + 1 nodes in the in-order traversal.

     * 
     * Hints:
     * -> Try simplifying the problem. What if the path had to start at the root?
     * -> Don't forget that paths could overlap. For example, if you're looking for the sum 6, the paths 1->3->2 and 1->3->2->4->-6->2 are both valid.
     * -> If each path had to start at the root, we could traverse all possible paths starting from the root. We can track the sum as we go, incrementing totalPaths each time we find a path with our target sum. Now, how do we extend this to paths that can start anywhere? Remember: Just get a brute-force algorithm done. You can optimize later.
     * -> To extend this to paths that start anywhere, we can just repeat this process for all nodes.
     * -> If you've designed the algorithm as described thus far, you'll have an O(N log N) algorithm in a balanced tree.This is because there are N nodes,each of which is at depth O(log N) at worst.

What our brute-force algorithm is really doing is taking each array and finding all contiguous subsequences that have a particular sum. We're doing this by computing all subarrays and their sums. It might be useful to just focus on this little subproblem. Given an array, how would you find all contiguous subsequences with a particular sum? Again, think about the duplicated work in the brute-force algorithm.
     * -> We are looking for subarrays with sum targetSum. Observe that we can track in constant time the value of running Sum i,where this is the sum from element O through element i. For a subarray of element i through element j to have sum targetSum, runningSum i-1 + targetSum must equal runningSum j (try drawing a picture of an array or a number line). Given that we can track the runningSum as we go, how can we quickly look up the number of indices i where the previous equation is true?
     * -> Try using a hash table that maps from a running Sumvalue to he number of elements with this runningSum.
     * -> Once you've solidified the algorithm to find all contiguous subarrays in an array with a given sum, try to apply this to a tree. Remember that as you're traversing and modifying the hash table, you may need to "reverse the damage" to the hash table as you traverse back up.
