/* 7.4 Parking Lot: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles
 * 
 * Hints:
 * -> Does the parking lot have multiple levels? What "features" does it support? Is it paid? What types of vehicles?
 * 
 * We make the following assumptions: 
 * The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
 * The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars, and buses.
 * The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.
 * A motorcycle can park in any spot.
 * A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
 * A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.
 * 
 * Essentially a wrapper class for an array of Levels
